# Python, the Language

While python is simple to use, it is a real programming language. It offers more structure and support for large programs than shell scripts or batch files.
Python also offers more error checking than C.

As a high level language, it has high-level data types built in - such as flexible arrays and dictionaries. Because of the availability of more general data types in Python than in Awk or Perl, it is applicable to a much larger problem domain.

Awk - scripting language used for manipulating data and generating reports
Perl - high-level, general purpose, interpreted and dynamic programming languages.

Python lets you split programs into modules.
Standard modules are available for - file I/O, system calls, sockets, GUI toolkits like Tk etc.

Interpreted language - saves time during development as no compilation and linking is necessary.

Shorter programs in python because - (1) high level data types let you express more in less lines (2) statement grouping done by indentation - no brackets (3) no need for variable or argument declarations

Extensible - with programs written in C.
